# Multi-subband-Monte-Carlo. 
It is my source code of Multi-subband Monte Carlo model for low field mobility calculation in Silicon Nanowire Transistor.
The model is to solve 2D Poisson equation and 2D Schrodinger equation in the cross-sectional plane and coupled with 1D Boltzmann equation on the transport direction. All relevant scatterings are included in the model.  
The documentation (written in 2011) is as below link.
